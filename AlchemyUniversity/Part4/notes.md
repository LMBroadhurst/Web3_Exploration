# Solidity
- statically-typed (fancy term meaning variables must be defined at compile time)
- supports inheritance: (specifically, smart contract inheritance chains)
- libraries
- complex user-defined types, among other features

## Syntax
```
function_keyword + function_name(paramter_list) + visibility {}
function helloWorld(bool _saysHello) public {
    // statements
}
 ```
